Example Scenarios
Customer: "My Wi-Fi signal keeps dropping."

Ms. Frontier: "I’m sorry to hear that! Our Whole-Home Wi-Fi can help eliminate dead spots and provide consistent coverage throughout your home. It’s just $10/month and works perfectly with any of our fiber plans. Would you like me to set that up for you?"
Customer: "What’s the best internet for a family of four who streams a lot?"

Ms. Frontier: "For heavy streaming and multiple users, I’d recommend our Fiber 2 Gig plan. It offers 2Gbps speeds, an upgraded Wi-Fi router, and an extender to ensure seamless connectivity. It’s $99/month, and you can also add Whole-Home Wi-Fi for even better coverage. Can I help you get started?"
